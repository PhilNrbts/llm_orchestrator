# Project Summary

This document provides a high-level summary of the LLM Orchestrator project, its current state, and potential future improvements.

## Core Functionality

The LLM Orchestrator is a command-line application that allows users to interact with multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) in a secure and efficient manner. Its key features are:

-   **Interactive Chat Interface:** A rich terminal UI built with `rich` and `prompt-toolkit` that provides a seamless user experience with command autocompletion, chat history, and real-time updates.
-   **Secure API Key Management:** API keys are stored in an encrypted vault (`vault.enc`) and are only decrypted in memory when needed.
-   **Multi-Provider Support:** The application is designed to be provider-agnostic, with support for multiple LLM providers (e.g., Gemini, Anthropic, etc.).
-   **Configuration-Driven:** The application is configured through simple YAML files (`config.yaml` and `models.yaml`), making it easy to add new providers, models, and chains.

## Current State

The project is in a functional state, with the core features implemented. The interactive chat is stable, and the command system is robust. The documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the application.

## What's Missing

While the project is functional, there are several areas that could be improved:

-   **Error Handling:** The application's error handling is basic. It could be improved to provide more informative error messages to the user.
-   **Testing:** The project has a basic set of tests, but it could be improved with more comprehensive testing, especially for the interactive chat.
-   **Code Quality:** The code could be improved by refactoring some of the larger files (e.g., `app/chat.py`) into smaller, more manageable modules.
-   **Asynchronous Operations:** The application uses `asyncio` for some operations, but it could be used more consistently throughout the application to improve performance.
-   **Streaming Support:** The application does not currently support streaming responses from the LLMs. This would be a major improvement to the user experience.
-   **More Providers:** The application could be improved by adding support for more LLM providers.
-   **More Complex Chains:** The application currently only supports simple, linear chains. It could be improved by adding support for more complex chains with branching and conditional logic.
-   **Better UI:** The UI could be improved with more features, such as the ability to view and edit the chat history, and the ability to save and load chat sessions.

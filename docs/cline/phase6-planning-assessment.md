## Roadmap Analysis

### Remaining Major Development Areas

#### 1. Enhanced Tool Usage and Extensibility (MCP Integration)
**Priority: HIGH** üü¢  
**Effort: MEDIUM** (4-6 weeks)  
**Impact: VERY HIGH** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Current Limitation**: Workflows are constrained by the small set of built-in tools (model_call, parallel_query). This limits the practical applications users can build.

**MCP Integration Benefits**:
- Access to 50+ pre-built tools (file operations, web search, databases, APIs)
- Standardized protocol for tool integration
- Community-driven tool ecosystem
- Composable server architecture

**Technical Approach**:
- Implement MCP client in the workflow engine
- Create MCP tool adapter for BaseTool interface
- Add MCP server configuration to config.yaml
- Integrate with existing memory system

#### 2. Robust Prompt Management
**Priority: MEDIUM** üü°  
**Effort: MEDIUM** (3-4 weeks)  
**Impact: HIGH** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Current State**: Prompts are embedded in workflow configurations. No optimization, versioning, or reformulation capabilities.

**Potential Features**:
- Interactive prompt reformulation with smaller models
- Jinja2 templating for complex prompt logic
- A/B testing and optimization tools
- Git-based prompt versioning
- Performance metrics and evaluation

#### 3. Strengthened Security and Trust
**Priority: MEDIUM** üü°  
**Effort: HIGH** (6-8 weeks)  
**Impact: MEDIUM** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Current State**: Basic vault-based key management. No fine-grained permissions or audit trails.

**Security Enhancements**:
- OAuth 2.1 authorization framework
- Fine-grained permission system
- Audit logging for all operations
- Human-in-the-loop approval gates
- Secure tool sandboxing

#### 4. Developer Experience and Maintainability
**Priority: LOW** üî¥  
**Effort: LOW** (1-2 weeks)  
**Impact: MEDIUM** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Current State**: Good documentation and testing, but could improve code quality processes.

**Improvements**:
- Pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting
- ADR (Architecture Decision Records) process
- Enhanced test coverage reporting
- Contributor guidelines and CI/CD

## Phase 6 Recommendation: Enhanced Tool Usage and Extensibility (MCP Integration)

### Why MCP Integration is the Optimal Next Phase

#### 1. **Maximum User Value**
- Transforms the orchestrator from a sophisticated prompt manager to a comprehensive automation platform

- Future-proofs the platform for ecosystem growth
- Enables community contributions through MCP server development

#### 4. **Technical Feasibility**
- MCP protocol is well-documented and stable
- Can integrate with existing BaseTool architecture
- Memory system already supports tool output persistence

### Phase 6 Implementation Plan

#### **Week 1-2: MCP Client Foundation**
- Implement MCP client protocol handler
- Create MCP server discovery and connection management
- Add MCP configuration to config.yaml schema

#### **Week 3-4: Tool Integration**
- Build MCP-to-BaseTool adapter
- Implement tool registry with MCP server tools
- Add tool capability detection and validation

#### **Week 5-6: Memory Integration**

### Expected Outcomes

#### **User Experience**
```yaml
workflows:
  research_and_publish:
    steps:
      - name: web_research
        tool: "mcp://web-search/search"
        inputs:
          query: "{{params.topic}}"
          max_results: 10
      
      - name: analyze_results
        tool: "model_call"
        memory:
          needs: ["tool_output(web_research)"]
        inputs:
          prompt: "Analyze: {{memory.web_research_output}}"
      
      - name: save_report
        tool: "mcp://file-operations/write"
        inputs:
          path: "reports/{{params.topic}}.md"
          content: "{{memory.analyze_results_output}}"

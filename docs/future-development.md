# Future Development Ideas

This document contains a more detailed and technical breakdown of potential future features and improvements for the llm-orchestrator. It serves as a supplement to the high-level `ROADMAP.md`.

## 1. Modular Home Directory System

**Target Location:** `~/.config/llm-orchestrator/`, `~/.local/share/llm-orchestrator/`

- __XDG Base Directory Compliance__: Cross-platform standard directories
- __Configuration Hierarchy__: System → User → Project level configurations
- __Profile Management__: Multiple user profiles with separate vaults
- __Migration Tools__: Automatic config migration between versions

## 2. Advanced Chain Architecture

**Target Location:** `app/chains/`, `app/workflows/`

- __Chain Definition Language__: YAML-based workflow descriptions
- __Conditional Logic__: If/then branching based on response analysis
- __Loop Constructs__: Iterative refinement with convergence criteria
- __Template System__: Pre-built workflow patterns
- __Visual Chain Builder__: Interactive workflow construction

## 3. Enhanced Mode System

**Target Location:** `app/modes/`, `config/modes/`

- __Context Modes__: Research, Creative, Technical, Debug with optimized prompts
- __Mode Inheritance__: Hierarchical mode configuration
- __Dynamic Mode Switching__: Context-aware mode transitions
- __Custom Mode Creation__: User-defined modes with specialized behaviors

## 4. Plugin Architecture

**Target Location:** `plugins/`, `app/plugin_manager.py`

- __Provider Plugins__: Easy addition of new LLM providers
- __Filter Plugins__: Content processing and transformation
- __Output Plugins__: Custom response formatting and export
- __Integration Plugins__: External tool connections



# Roadmap

## High-Level Vision

The llm-orchestrator aims to be a powerful, local-first, and highly extensible tool for developers and researchers to manage complex interactions with Large Language Models. Our vision is to create a system that is not only robust and secure but also transparent and easy to understand, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment.

For more detailed, actionable items, please see the GitHub Issues for this project. For major architectural decisions, please refer to the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the `docs/architecture/adr` directory. For a more technical breakdown of the ideas listed below, see the [Future Development Ideas](docs/future-development.md) document.

## Future Directions

### Evolving the Orchestration Paradigm
We plan to explore more sophisticated orchestration paradigms beyond simple parallel and sequential queries, such as conversation-driven, process-centric, and toolkit-based orchestration.

### Enhancing Tool Usage and Extensibility
We will investigate integrating with standardized tool management systems like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expand the orchestrator's capabilities and allow for more seamless integration of external tools.

### Strengthening Security and Trust Mechanisms
We will enhance the security of the orchestrator by incorporating principles such as user consent and control for all operations, mandatory human approval for tool invocations, and a robust authorization framework.

### Advanced State and Memory Management
We will explore more dynamic memory systems, such as vector databases and tiered memory systems, to enable more complex operations and long-term memory.

### Enhancing Internal Code Representation and Understanding
We will improve the clarity and maintainability of the codebase by enforcing comprehensive docstrings, using hyperlinks to connect code to documentation, and exploring AI-powered code summarization and interactive code-knowledge graphs.

### Robust Prompt Management and Optimization
We will implement more robust prompt management and optimization techniques, including advanced templating, versioning, and A/B testing, to improve the performance and reliability of the orchestrator.

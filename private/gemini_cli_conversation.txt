This is a summary of our conversation:

- You started by asking me to help you set up default models and providers for your LLM orchestrator application.
- I inspected the configuration files and the application's code to understand how it works.
- I implemented a new slash command system in `app/chat.py` with features like `/help`, `/list`, `/config`, and `/mode`.
- I added a `chat list` command to `app/main.py` to list saved conversations.
- You then asked for a more advanced UI with a command dropdown and a bordered layout.
- I updated `app/chat.py` to use the `rich` library for a more sophisticated UI.
- We worked through several bugs, including an `ImportError`, a `getpass` issue, and a `NameError`.
- You asked me to push the project to GitHub, which I did.
- You then asked for a better command dropdown, so I added `prompt-toolkit` to the project and implemented a custom completer.
- We worked through a few more bugs with the command completer until it was working to your satisfaction.
- You asked me to enrich the `models.yaml` file with more Gemini models, which I did.
- Finally, you asked me to save our conversation, and I am doing so now.
